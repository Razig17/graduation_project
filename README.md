Assignment one: 
Objective: Build a deep learning model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using the IMDb dataset.
Task Instructions:- Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load the IMDb dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.Preprocess the data by padding/truncating the sequences to a fixed length.
- Model Architecture:
An Embedding layer to map word indices to dense vectors.An LSTM layer to capture sequential patterns in the reviews.A Dense layer with appropriate activation for binary classification.
- Model Training:
Train the model using the binary cross entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.Use validation data to monitor the model’s performance during training.
- Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the test set and report the accuracy.
- Prediction:
Classify "I did not enjoy the movie."
